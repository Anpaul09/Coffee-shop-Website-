            <h1>Coffee Nutrition</h1>
            <p>Enjoying your favorite cup of coffee not only provides a delightful experience but also comes with some nutritional benefits:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Antioxidants:</strong> Coffee is rich in antioxidants, which help fight free radicals in the body.</li>
                <li><strong>Vitamins and Minerals:</strong> Coffee contains small amounts of essential nutrients like vitamins B2 (riboflavin), B3 (niacin), and manganese.</li>
                <li><strong>Boosts Metabolism:</strong> Caffeine in coffee can increase metabolic rate and aid in fat burning.</li>
                <li><strong>Mental Alertness:</strong> Coffee helps improve cognitive function and keeps you mentally alert.</li>
                <li><strong>May Lower the Risk of Certain Diseases:</strong> Some studies suggest that regular coffee consumption may reduce the risk of certain diseases, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>It's important to note that while coffee can have health benefits, moderation is key. Too much caffeine may lead to negative effects, such as increased heart rate and disrupted sleep.</p>
